    <h1>HERMIONE</h1>
    <img src="kk.jpg" height="600" width="900">
    <p>Hermione Granger is a central protagonist in the Harry Potter series, widely celebrated as the "brightest witch of her age" for her extraordinary intellect and mastery of magic. Born to Muggle parents, she enters Hogwarts with a fierce dedication to her studies, often using her encyclopedic knowledge and logical reasoning to save her best friends, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, from countless perilous situations. While initially perceived by peers as an "insufferable know-it-all," her character is defined by a deep moral compass and unwavering loyalty. She famously champions the rights of the marginalized, such as house-elves through her organization S.P.E.W., and repeatedly risks her life in the fight against Lord Voldemort.<br>Beyond her academic achievements, Hermione’s journey is one of personal growth, evolving from a rule-abiding student into a courageous leader and key strategist during the Second Wizarding War. Following the war, she continues her legacy of reform within the Ministry of Magic, eventually rising to the position of Minister for Magic by 2019. In popular culture, she was famously portrayed by Emma Watson in the original film series. For the upcoming 2027 HBO television reboot, Arabella Stanton has been cast to take on the iconic role, bringing a fresh perspective to the character for a new generation of viewers.</p>
