    <img src="Draco_Mal.JPG" height="600" width="700">
    <p>Draco Malfoy is the primary school-age antagonist and rival to Harry Potter, characterized by his pale, pointed features and arrogant demeanor. Raised in a wealthy, pure-blood family with deep ties to Lord Voldemort, Draco enters Hogwarts as a spoiled bully who frequently uses his father Lucius Malfoy's influence to intimidate others. His early years are defined by a bitter animosity toward Harry, whom he envies for his fame and talent, and by his bigoted treatment of Muggle-borns like Hermione Granger. Despite his cruelty, he is a capable wizard, excelling in disciplines such as Occlumency and Potions, often while being flanked by his two henchmen, Crabbe and Goyle.<br>Draco's character arc shifts dramatically in the later books when he is forced into Voldemort's service as a 16-year-old Death Eater. Tasked with the near-impossible mission of assassinating Albus Dumbledore to save his family from the Dark Lord's wrath, Draco’s initial eagerness quickly turns to fear and physical deterioration under the crushing pressure. Although he successfully infiltrates Death Eaters into Hogwarts, he finds himself unable to commit cold-blooded murder when he finally corners a defenseless Dumbledore. This internal conflict continues through the end of the war, where he reluctantly assists his family's defection. In his adulthood, Draco abandons the pure-blood prejudices of his youth, raising his son Scorpius with a more tolerant worldview and maintaining a civil, albeit distant, relationship with his former rival.</p>
